Hello! I am Will Tekulve, a current undergraduate student at the University of Cincinnati double majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
Most of my life has been spent being involved in competitive robotics through the [FIRST robotics program](https://www.firstinspires.org/) where I have spent 5 years competing in FLL, 3 in FTC, and 5 years mentoring and coaching across the nation while traveling on co-op.
These experiences have given me a deep interest in automation, in both pure software and more of a mix of soft and hardware like controls engineering.

I am currently planning to graduate in the spring of 2020 and am looking for opportunities for full time employment post graduation. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me at the information provided below.

# Co-op Work Experience

## Kinetic Vision (January 2017 - April 2017)

I started my co-op career at UC with Kinetic Vision, a local Cincinnati engineering firm that does a large variety of work.
At this time I was only majoring in Computer Science and I was placed into the Virtual Reality team.
This team used Unity and the HTC Vive with SteamVR to create Virtual Reality demos of everything from medical devices to airplanes.
As part of these projects I also gained experience the Google Cloud infrastructure, using AppEngine and DataStore to create a user login system for one of the VR demos.

At KV I worked a lot on professional communication.
I was able to run a lot of my own projects but that meant I had to keep good lines of communication open with the people designing the assets for the VR demos as well as my managers who were interacting directly with clients.
This ensured we were able to create the features that clients requested in a timely manner and we were also able to ensure that the final product met our standards for quality and functionality. 

## Patheon (August 2017 - April 2018)

For my second and third co-op terms I spent time in Greenville, North Carolina working at Patheon.
Patheon, now a part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, runs a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant there and I chose to work at that plant to gain some experience working in controls engineering.
I wanted to use this experience as a stepping stone towards applying to co-op at Tesla.

### Fall 2018

#### Controls Engineering Intro

After I arrived in North Carolina I was assigned to work with the steriles automation team.
They maintained the PLCs (programmable logic controller) which ran the machines on the steriles production lines for the entire building.
These machines produced sterile medicine for injection, including the vial sterilization, filling, and capping processes.

#### Datacenter VM Maintenance

All of the HMIs (human machine interface) that operators used on the production lines were ran from a centralized virtual machine datacenter that my team also maintained.
We used VMWare's Enterprise vSphere software to control the creation of and monitor all of the virtual machines.

#### SCADA

SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) is a generic term used for software created for the purpose of running, interacting with, and monitoring PLCs and their associated machinery.
There are a few widely used applications and Patheon used a combination of Rockwell Automation's *FactoryTalk* suite and Inductive Automation's *Ignition*.

### Spring 2019

#### Black Box Integration

During the Spring I was moved to a different area of the plant.
Here I was given a project to integrate a new-to-the-site data collection software with a machine on a manufacturing line that we currently had no access or insight to.
This was a pretty involved project and took me the majority of the term as I had to go back and forth with the original manufacturers of the machine, figure out what hardware it ran on, and develop a plan that would let the validation team allow us to modify a machine running in production.

#### Advanced Ignition

The data collection software we used for the *Black Box Integration* was called *Ignition* by Inductive Automation.
*Ignition* was designed as a SCADA system replacement for other systems, like Rockwell Automation's *FactoryTalk*.
I was able to create a fully functioning OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) tracker for the black box machine on our line with *Ignition*.

### Non-Technical Skills

The pharmaceutical industry was new to me when I started this position and I really had no clue just how pervasive change restrictions would be.
It took me a while to realize that some changes, while they would undoubtedly benefit the overall system, would just be too difficult or take too long to validate to be possible.
I also had to learn that some people just wanted to maintain the system the way it was, without making improvements or major changes.


## Tesla (August 2018 - December 2018)

I spent the Fall semester of 2018 working at Tesla's Gigafactory 1 plant in Sparks, Nevada for my fourth co-op term.
Gigafactory 1 is a massive plant Tesla constructed in the High Sierra deserts where they work in conjunction with Panasonic to produce multiple products for Tesla Motors and Tesla Energy.
My time there was spent working on the Model 3 Drive Unit and Battery Pack manufacturing lines.

As a controls engineer, this opportunity was my first job that gave me hands on experience with PLCs and writing Ladder Logic.
My time on a lot of different projects, some as simple as reducing cycle time on bottleneck stations while others were as complex as writing software for a brand new line in the factory.
I also learned that while the pace at GF1 is ridiculously fast, there are times when it's critical to take some time and fully think through a problem.
The fastest way to solve a problem doesn't necessarily overlap with the best way to solve the problem.

## Tesla (May 2019 - August 2019)

My return to Tesla's Gigafactory 1 was kicked off with a bang.
After only a few hours on-site I was already put to work on the PowerWall manufacturing line.

Through the large variety of projects I was a part of this semester I received a ton of experience commissioning new manufacturing tools, stations, and software projects.
I was able to travel to other Tesla sites and vendors as part of my work on these projects.

# Project Sought

I am currently looking for projects that bridge the gap between pure Computer Science and pure Electrical Engineering that fits within the manufacturing space.
Much of my background is in software development and I would like that to be a significant portion of my senior design project.
This could (and hopefully will) include embedded systems, backend technologies, and frontend web design.
