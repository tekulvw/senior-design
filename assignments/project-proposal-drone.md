# Drone Video Data Mining Framework

## Team Members

* Will Tekulve - tekulvwc@mail.uc.edu
* Others TBD

## Faculty Advisor

* Mehdi Norouzi - norouzmi@ucmail.uc.edu

## Project Description

Drone video and the metadata associated with it has large potential for data mining that can be exploited.
This project would be focused on creating a drone video data mining framework on Google Cloud to ingest, process, and produce results for a variety of applications.
The current focus is on DoT traffic data.

## Inadequacy of Current Solutions

* Drone video metadata has not been used to full potential in known applications
* No generic platform for processing/analysis
* Various tech exists for processing this video but has not been merged in a "turnkey" type solution

## Background Skills

* Backend software development through employment and co-ops
* Experience with Golang/Python/Google Cloud
* Minor experience in deep learning development

## Goals/Expectations

* Develop a Google Cloud based framework
* Ingest drone video streams
* Process data in meaningful way for specific applications
* Produce meaningful results based on that data
