# Development of a Pinball Machine

## Team Members

* Will Tekulve - tekulvwc@mail.uc.edu
* Others TBD

## Faculty Advisor

* Zacharaiah Fuchs - fuchsze@ucmail.uc.edu

## Project Description

We will be developing the embedded system to control and run a pinball machine.
This includes all software for any microcontrollers in the system, all sensors in the machine and all motors/servos necessary for standard operation.
Additionally, there may be opportunity to develop a computer vision system to track the pinball during play.
This tracking system could be used to develop an AI to play the machine in the real world.

## Inadequacy of Current Solutions

* UC does not currently have a pinball machine to be used for deep learning/computer vision research
* Ball tracking is difficult due to lighting and reflectiveness

## Background Skills

* Controls Engineering Co-op
* Embedded systems development
* Experience with C/C++/Python
* Minor experience in deep learning development

## Goals/Expectations

* Develop a working pinball machine
* External control over flippers in machine
