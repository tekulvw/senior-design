# Individual Capstone Assessment

## Project Introduction

Stern Pinball has donated pinball flippers, pop bumpers, slingshots and other pinball machine parts for a pinball machine.
These parts are to be used by my team to design and build a functioning pinball machine.
We will be combining these parts with microcontrollers and distributed PCBs that we will be organizing and programming as part of this capstone project.
This project will be a deep dive into embedded systems programming and systems engineering.
We may also need to provide an external API for controlling the pinball machine for use in future research project.
The design of this machine will be used in an upcoming Pinball Mechatronics course.

## College Coursework Experience

My group members come from three different majors and each have had different coursework experiences.
I am the only CS major in the group and my experiences should be a great benefit to the group as a whole.
I plan to pull heavily from my Software Engineering, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, and Introduction to Computer Architecture courses.
Software Engineering (EECE3093C) taught me how to effectively and efficiently design and manage a large group software project.
As this project will include a large amount of embedded programming, I think this course is especially relevant.
Coursework from Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CS4071) will be useful in designing efficient algorithms for management and determination of scoring.
Introduction to Computing Systems (CS2011) is indirectly relevant, the coursework had us learning about machines at a lower level than I'll be using for this capstone project, but the way we were taught to think about problems and solutions will be helpful.

## Co-op Employment Experience

I have spent four out of my five co-op rotations working as a Controls Engineer, two for Patheon (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and two for Tesla.
Three out of four members of my group have also had Controls Engineering experience at companies such as Intelligrated and Bosch.
Our experiences as a Controls Engineers will be extremely applicable to this capstone project.
The focus of all four of my co-op rotations has been on system design, process development, and device integration.
I spent the majority of my time working on PLC code for Modicon and Allen Bradley based systems, but I also had a chance to improve my Python and Golang skills to create mission critical applications.
At Tesla I also had a chance to work on a large and extraordinarily agile team which helped me improve my time management and communication skills.
These skills are absolutely necessary for cross-functional teams with dedicated purposes like the environment at Tesla and as I expect this project to have.

## Project Motivation

I believe this capstone project represents my coursework, co-op experiences, and future aspirations especially well as it incorporates system development, very low level software, and software controlling hardware.
Seeing the results of code impact the real world is fascinating to me, I got to see this before college when I competed in FIRST robotics and during my co-op rotations.
I also have an interest in getting into low level code for things like kernel driver or embedded systems development.
There is a potential to have a lack of new, highly qualified low level programmers in the near future so gaining experience in this field will be highly valuable.
My team is extremely qualified and I always enjoy working with motivated and capable people.
Plus, making a pinball machine seems like a lot of fun!

## Preliminary Approach

We will design and program an embedded system to control the pinball machine that consists of a master processing board and several modular PCB boards.
This system will control the various mechanical parts of the pinball machine.
We will also design a playfield for the machine and a rule set with multiple different states activated by certain shots.
After this work is completed, we may team up with students from DAAP to assist with the playfield design and theme.

**We have the first team meeting on Tuesday 9/17 after class.**
**As of now I'm not sure what the preliminary approach will fully look like.**
**I will be adding more information to this document after that meeting.**
